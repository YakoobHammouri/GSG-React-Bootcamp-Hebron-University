## React Lifecycle

Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: **Mounting**, **Updating**, and **Unmounting**.

### Mounting
In React, the Mounting lifecycle is a initial-render means when putting elements into the Real DOM. It involves initializing the component, rendering its JSX representation, and executing any necessary setup tasks.


### Updating
In React, the Updating lifecycle refers to the series of events that occur when a component's state or props change. It involves re-rendering the component with updated data and executing any necessary logic or side effects.

### Unmounting
In React, the Unmounting lifecycle refers to the phase when a component is being removed from the DOM. It involves cleaning up any resources that the component may have established during its lifecycle
